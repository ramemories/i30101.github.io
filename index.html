                <p>Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:27 EST</p>
                <p>I've never liked sleeping a lot. I'm often stuck in a cycle where I lose sleep, regret losing it, indulge in it, and regret indulging in it, which leads me to lose more sleep all over again. </p>
                <p>Recently, I started tracking my sleep patterns on my watch, and I have to admit it's been motivating me to improve the quality of my sleep. I try to sleep before 11 PM and get 8 hours of rest; I've also begun to wake up at 6:30 every day. Of course, 6:30 isn't ideal but it's a lot better than before, when I was filthily lazy in the mornings. The first thing I do when I get up is check my watch, because for some reason it fascinates me to see how many hours of sleep I got. I guess my watch has made sleeping into a productive activity, which has improved my regard for it. </p>
                <p>One weird thing about my sleeping habits is that I don't sleep with a pillow. At one point in the past year or two, I wondered why literally everyone slept with a pillow. I knew that the Ancient Egyptians used wooden headrests while sleeping, but as I couldn't figure out why people today had to follow them and put something under their heads while in bed. After that thought, I never considered pillows to be comfortable again.</p>
                <p>This improved the quality of my sleep profoundly. But I still haven't been able to dream regularly. The last significant dream I had was before the AP World History test on the night of May 10th, 2023. I dreamed that the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) and Short Answer Question (SAQ) sections were merged and I spent too much time on the MCQs, leaving me no time for the SAQs. In reality, I did well on the MCQ and SAQ but did terribly on the Free Response Questions (FRQs). How unprodutive of a dream.</p>
                <p>My neck is hurting now and I want to return to my bed. But I have an AP Chemistry quiz tomorrow and some AP US History work to do, so I'll linger for a bit before I go up. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Costco</div>
                <p>Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:25 PM EST</p>
                <p>One time, when I was perhaps 6 years old, my family went to a Costco warehouse when we were on a road trip. We visited Costco often, and still do today. But since this branch wasn't a one I had visited before, I didn't know the layout and got lost. I walked bewteen the towering pallets, bewildered by the goods that were stacked high above me. Only moments ago had I been within a safe radius of my parents; now I was alone and meandering. </p>
                <p>I was frightened and didn't know what to do. All of a sudden, all that had meant much to me was nowhere in sight, and the once-familiar stacks of canned and packaged food were formidable and unwelcoming. The absence of three people for just a moment had augmented my thoughts. </p>
                <p>Eventually, a staffer found me loitering in an empy lane, and taking a quick look around, found my parents just around the corner. But now, years later, that feeling of getting lost hasn't gone away. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Potbelly Cravings</div>
                <p>Wednesday 9.27.2023 11:02 pm EST</p>
                <p>The States team is having a meeting to create the teams for this year, and we'll all be eating Potbelly. My favorite restaurant chain is Potebelly by a long shot. I've always been disappointed by the low quality of Subway sandwiches because they have so little meat and every sandwich tastes the same. But each Potbelly sandwich type has a different character, and whatever you order, you always get enough filling, so you're never left unsatisfied. I can't recall the exact scenario where I first ordered a Potbelly sandwich, but I do recall being immensely pleased with how good it tasted and how filling it was.</p>
                <p>It's crazy how I've been thinking about a sandwich this entire week. I settled on an original Steakhouse Beef with mayo, extra lettuce, extra onions, extra tomatoes, cucumbers, artichoke hearts, and probably a few more things. I knew I'd feel hungry while placing my order, but ordering 7 other sandwiches was too cruel to my empty stomach. </p>
                <p>I wonder why some people view my management of our Science Olympiad team as questionable. Actually, they don't question my choices, they just complain about how I make those choices. It's not even complaining, either - they just talk amongst themselves and I find out through Jamie. I don't think I try to be overbearing, and I definitely don't make all the decisions by myself, since I'm constantly discussing things with Sophia, Zahra, and Mrs. Babcock. Honestly, I'd blame it on the incompetent Sophomores who are annoyed about Jamie, who they view as having more opportunities. Honestly, it infuriates me how they're the same people supporting Ivy and telling her tryouts test contents and structures along with her performance rankings, which I explicitly stated that they should remain private. </p>
                <p>But then again, I've been questioning decisions I've made recently, and with good reason. It's not that I'm remorseful, it's just that I may be toeing the line for what I should and should not be doing a leader of the team. So I guess those naysayers are in the same boat as I am. </p>
                <p>Man, I am so hungry right now. I would eat my calculus textbook if I didn't have to study for a quiz tomorrow.</p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Freedom and Religion</div>
                <p>Monday 10.2.2023 10:13 PM EST</p>
                <p>At this moment, I am experiencing a period of freedom that occurs once a year. My parents are out of town right now because my mom's company, New York Life, holds councils across the world where they invite their best salespeople and have them celebrate together. Up to my Freshman year, my sister and I went to every council meeting. They were somewhat excessive, but at least the company provided us with all the food, lodging, and venues. When my mom performed well certain years and qualified to attend higher councils, the entertainment and activities would be better. During the Chariman's Council in October of 2021, our family stayed at a huge resort in Phoenix and ate very well. We got shipped around in tour buses to various locations, including museums and a horseback riding venue. The trips were fun, but now my sister and I are too busy to go along. Which is why the two of us are stuck here. </p>
                <p>It's a pity that I can't drive right now. This morning, I woke up at 7:20 AM after falling asleep twice, at 6:00 and 6:30. I had 15 minutes to pack my lunch, prepare my bag, and run to the bus stop. Waking up that late was my fault, and I paid the price today by being extremely tired. I was luckly to have prepared my lunch the night before. But despite our apparent lack of self-regulation, it's nice not having my mother and father around. I have to manage a lot of things by myself; I mowed and trimmed the lawn, cooked, and did the laundry. But I feel more productive and self-directed without them here. </p>
                <p>Totally irrelevant, but I've been thinkging about religion at times recently. Not too deeply, but from time to time. I'm a strong atheist, and I believe that there could be no higher power that controls us. Religion, resultant of humanity's desire for developing social heirarchies and shielding ignorance with the supernatural, is no more factual than the Dickens book on my desk right now. My feelings for religion border on condescension. But religion has its impacts on everyone. </p>
                <p>About a month ago, I was talking with Harun about his religious beliefs. Being a Muslim, he said that he distances himself from his background's religious standards that can be viewed as racist or sexist. In other words, he had the mind to be critical of the faith he was reared in. I was inspired, and commmended him for his progressive thinking. </p>
                <p>Not long after, I was meeting with Jamie's friends in a meeting room in the City of Fairfax Public Library. One of them, Brian, was a Muslim. While we were talking, he said that he would do his prayer, and Jamie hushed me so he could conduct his prayer in silence. That moment put religion in a new light for me. From my first impressions of Brian, he seemed a kind and honest kid. And even though I looked down on religion, seeing his genuine faith in his God inspired me. Even though just a child, Brian could dedicate his virtues and character to a God and a faith, and that he would go about his religious activities in the presence and potential criticism of his peers, was just shy of a revelation. I was very impressed. </p>
                <p>I think neither pious devotion nor endorsement of progress can be measures of one's moral and religious character - they can only be measured only in terms of respect. I found Harun virtuous because he respected his own forward-thinking beliefs that stepped away from his religious traditions, and he never discussed those thoughts with the intention to actively spread them. I found Brian virtuous because he respected his beliefs but never tried to impose them on others. As long as you're true to yourself and mindful of others, I guess religion can be just as good as the absence of it. </p>
                <p>But in many cases, religion is tainted and unpure. While I was working on the lawn this Sunday, a Honda Accord drove up to our cul-de-sac and a late middle-aged Korean man stepped out. In Korean, he asked me if I was from Korea and gave me a pamphlet about their church. I didn't take a second look and put it aside, continuing to clear the driveway with my blower. The first man stepped back into the car and the driver started it, but after creeping forward for two yards, they stopped. I could tell they were watching me mow the lawn, and after around 10 minutes, the driver came out and began to talk to me. I lowered the setting on my blower before turning it off. </p>
                <p>The man introduced himself as the pastor of some church in Annandale (behing the 9292 restaurant) and began his schpiel about God. I listened out of politeness, but I knew from the start what he was trying to do. He asked what grade I was in, what my name was, and whether I went to church. I answered his questions like an idiot, but I gave him my legally unrecognized Korean name and he understood my grade incorrectly. Either way, I won't respond at all when some guy like him comes up. But back to his schpiel. He started off with a religious appeal, but seeing my lack of appreciation for his Presbyterian God, he switched to a personal appeal, saying God helps everyone. That didn't work either, so he talked about academics and college, saying God would follow me throughout my academic journey. Bullshit. I put on a disinterested look and he went away, but I was disappointed that I didn't send him off sooner. </p>
                <p>It is these religious followerse I despise. I had a friend in 5th grade who tried to convert me to Catholicism, and that ruined my good regard for him. And that bastard pastor - he has some ego thinking he can go around converting every Joe and Jane. </p>
                <p>The license plate of the Accord was VYT-2107.</p>

                <p>I got 4 hours of sleep last night and the night before. I got 4 hours on Tuesday because I was finishing an essay for AP English Language and Composition, and I got 4 hours last night because I was studying for a Spanish exam I failed. It's not good that I'm sleeping this late considering my grades. I also crashed twice in school today - in Data Structures, where I took a 10 minute nap and couldn't see clearly for 20 minutes, and BC Calculus, where I missed two pages of notes.</p>
                <p>If I'm tired this early, I'm going to be a lot more tired in January and Februrary. I'll have four Science Olympiad competitions in the first two months of 2024. Last year, I got virtually 3 hours of sleep for 3-4 days a week for 3 months straight. Just thinking about those days make me quaver inside.</p>

                <p>I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday. According to my watch, I fell asleep at 11:56 PM. I should've gotten more considering how much I missed this week. I feel asleep during Mr. Sorenson's Physics lecture and I think I might fall asleep soon. </p>
                <p>I have changed so much in the past year. I am completely different from who I was before the year to the point that I cannot recognize my former self. I met new people, my academics improved and worsened, I matured and remained a child. I had many successes; I won medals, positions, and awards. I had many defeats; I didn't win awards, my paper got rejected, and I failed to succeed academically. I left a friend. I crashed my bike. I fell in love with a campus. I'm in the middle of losing my dream. And a year ago, I couldn't have seen any of these things happening to me, nor can I guess at what's ahead.</p>
                <p>Who knows what I'll be like next year?</p>

                <p>
                    All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless <br>
                    So rude and always negative <br>
                    I need new friends but it's not that quick and easy <br>
                    Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe <br>
                    I'm better off all by myself <br>
                    Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, I hear you crying out for help <br>
                    But you never showed up for me when I was rining your cellphone <br>
                    Oh, You don't know how it feels to be alone <br>
                    Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know <br>

                    I feel into your river <br>
                    That's where you told me lies <br>
                    You said that I'd feel better <br>
                    But this is where the good guys die <br>
                    You took my pride away, but <br>
                    You cannot take my life <br>
                    I'll find another way <br>
                    I'll wonder if you're taking my life <br>
                    Don't you see how I... <br>
