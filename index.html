                <div class="intro entry-title">Entry: The Productivity of Dreams</div>
                <p>Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:27 EST</p>
                <p>I've never liked sleeping a lot. I'm often stuck in a cycle where I lose sleep, regret losing it, indulge in it, and regret indulging in it, which leads me to lose more sleep all over again. </p>
                <p>Recently, I started tracking my sleep patterns on my watch, and I have to admit it's been motivating me to improve the quality of my sleep. I try to sleep before 11 PM and get 8 hours of rest; I've also begun to wake up at 6:30 every day. Of course, 6:30 isn't ideal but it's a lot better than before, when I was filthily lazy in the mornings. The first thing I do when I get up is check my watch, because for some reason it fascinates me to see how many hours of sleep I got. I guess my watch has made sleeping into a productive activity, which has improved my regard for it. </p>
                <p>One weird thing about my sleeping habits is that I don't sleep with a pillow. At one point in the past year or two, I wondered why literally everyone slept with a pillow. I knew that the Ancient Egyptians used wooden headrests while sleeping, but as I couldn't figure out why people today had to follow them and put something under their heads while in bed. After that thought, I never considered pillows to be comfortable again.</p>
                <p>This improved the quality of my sleep profoundly. But I still haven't been able to dream regularly. The last significant dream I had was before the AP World History test on the night of May 10th, 2023. I dreamed that the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) and Short Answer Question (SAQ) sections were merged and I spent too much time on the MCQs, leaving me no time for the SAQs. In reality, I did well on the MCQ and SAQ but did terribly on the Free Response Questions (FRQs). How unprodutive of a dream.</p>
                <p>My neck is hurting now and I want to return to my bed. But I have an AP Chemistry quiz tomorrow and some AP US History work to do, so I'll linger for a bit before I go up. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Costco</div>
                <p>Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:25 PM EST</p>
                <p>One time, when I was perhaps 6 years old, my family went to a Costco warehouse when we were on a road trip. We visited Costco often, and still do today. But since this branch wasn't a one I had visited before, I didn't know the layout and got lost. I walked bewteen the towering pallets, bewildered by the goods that were stacked high above me. Only moments ago had I been within a safe radius of my parents; now I was alone and meandering. </p>
                <p>I was frightened and didn't know what to do. All of a sudden, all that had meant much to me was nowhere in sight, and the once-familiar stacks of canned and packaged food were formidable and unwelcoming. The absence of three people for just a moment had augmented my thoughts. </p>
                <p>Eventually, a staffer found me loitering in an empy lane, and taking a quick look around, found my parents just around the corner. But now, years later, that feeling of getting lost hasn't gone away. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Potbelly Cravings</div>
                <p>Wednesday 9.27.2023 11:02 pm EST</p>
                <p>The States team is having a meeting to create the teams for this year, and we'll all be eating Potbelly. My favorite restaurant chain is Potebelly by a long shot. I've always been disappointed by the low quality of Subway sandwiches because they have so little meat and every sandwich tastes the same. But each Potbelly sandwich type has a different character, and whatever you order, you always get enough filling, so you're never left unsatisfied. I can't recall the exact scenario where I first ordered a Potbelly sandwich, but I do recall being immensely pleased with how good it tasted and how filling it was.</p>
                <p>It's crazy how I've been thinking about a sandwich this entire week. I settled on an original Steakhouse Beef with mayo, extra lettuce, extra onions, extra tomatoes, cucumbers, artichoke hearts, and probably a few more things. I knew I'd feel hungry while placing my order, but ordering 7 other sandwiches was too cruel to my empty stomach. </p>
                <p>I wonder why some people view my management of our Science Olympiad team as questionable. Actually, they don't question my choices, they just complain about how I make those choices. It's not even complaining, either - they just talk amongst themselves and I find out through Jamie. I don't think I try to be overbearing, and I definitely don't make all the decisions by myself, since I'm constantly discussing things with Sophia, Zahra, and Mrs. Babcock. Honestly, I'd blame it on the incompetent Sophomores who are annoyed about Jamie, who they view as having more opportunities. Honestly, it infuriates me how they're the same people supporting Ivy and telling her tryouts test contents and structures along with her performance rankings, which I explicitly stated that they should remain private. </p>
                <p>But then again, I've been questioning decisions I've made recently, and with good reason. It's not that I'm remorseful, it's just that I may be toeing the line for what I should and should not be doing a leader of the team. So I guess those naysayers are in the same boat as I am. </p>
                <p>Man, I am so hungry right now. I would eat my calculus textbook if I didn't have to study for a quiz tomorrow.</p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Freedom and Religion</div>
                <p>Monday 10.2.2023 10:13 PM EST</p>
                <p>At this moment, I am experiencing a period of freedom that occurs once a year. My parents are out of town right now because my mom's company, New York Life, holds councils across the world where they invite their best salespeople and have them celebrate together. Up to my Freshman year, my sister and I went to every council meeting. They were somewhat excessive, but at least the company provided us with all the food, lodging, and venues. When my mom performed well certain years and qualified to attend higher councils, the entertainment and activities would be better. During the Chariman's Council in October of 2021, our family stayed at a huge resort in Phoenix and ate very well. We got shipped around in tour buses to various locations, including museums and a horseback riding venue. The trips were fun, but now my sister and I are too busy to go along. Which is why the two of us are stuck here. </p>
                <p>It's a pity that I can't drive right now. This morning, I woke up at 7:20 AM after falling asleep twice, at 6:00 and 6:30. I had 15 minutes to pack my lunch, prepare my bag, and run to the bus stop. Waking up that late was my fault, and I paid the price today by being extremely tired. I was luckly to have prepared my lunch the night before. But despite our apparent lack of self-regulation, it's nice not having my mother and father around. I have to manage a lot of things by myself; I mowed and trimmed the lawn, cooked, and did the laundry. But I feel more productive and self-directed without them here. </p>
                <p>Totally irrelevant, but I've been thinkging about religion at times recently. Not too deeply, but from time to time. I'm a strong atheist, and I believe that there could be no higher power that controls us. Religion, resultant of humanity's desire for developing social heirarchies and shielding ignorance with the supernatural, is no more factual than the Dickens book on my desk right now. My feelings for religion border on condescension. But religion has its impacts on everyone. </p>
                <p>About a month ago, I was talking with Harun about his religious beliefs. Being a Muslim, he said that he distances himself from his background's religious standards that can be viewed as racist or sexist. In other words, he had the mind to be critical of the faith he was reared in. I was inspired, and commmended him for his progressive thinking. </p>
                <p>Not long after, I was meeting with Jamie's friends in a meeting room in the City of Fairfax Public Library. One of them, Brian, was a Muslim. While we were talking, he said that he would do his prayer, and Jamie hushed me so he could conduct his prayer in silence. That moment put religion in a new light for me. From my first impressions of Brian, he seemed a kind and honest kid. And even though I looked down on religion, seeing his genuine faith in his God inspired me. Even though just a child, Brian could dedicate his virtues and character to a God and a faith, and that he would go about his religious activities in the presence and potential criticism of his peers, was just shy of a revelation. I was very impressed. </p>
                <p>I think neither pious devotion nor endorsement of progress can be measures of one's moral and religious character - they can only be measured only in terms of respect. I found Harun virtuous because he respected his own forward-thinking beliefs that stepped away from his religious traditions, and he never discussed those thoughts with the intention to actively spread them. I found Brian virtuous because he respected his beliefs but never tried to impose them on others. As long as you're true to yourself and mindful of others, I guess religion can be just as good as the absence of it. </p>
                <p>But in many cases, religion is tainted and unpure. While I was working on the lawn this Sunday, a Honda Accord drove up to our cul-de-sac and a late middle-aged Korean man stepped out. In Korean, he asked me if I was from Korea and gave me a pamphlet about their church. I didn't take a second look and put it aside, continuing to clear the driveway with my blower. The first man stepped back into the car and the driver started it, but after creeping forward for two yards, they stopped. I could tell they were watching me mow the lawn, and after around 10 minutes, the driver came out and began to talk to me. I lowered the setting on my blower before turning it off. </p>
                <p>The man introduced himself as the pastor of some church in Annandale (behing the 9292 restaurant) and began his schpiel about God. I listened out of politeness, but I knew from the start what he was trying to do. He asked what grade I was in, what my name was, and whether I went to church. I answered his questions like an idiot, but I gave him my legally unrecognized Korean name and he understood my grade incorrectly. Either way, I won't respond at all when some guy like him comes up. But back to his schpiel. He started off with a religious appeal, but seeing my lack of appreciation for his Presbyterian God, he switched to a personal appeal, saying God helps everyone. That didn't work either, so he talked about academics and college, saying God would follow me throughout my academic journey. Bullshit. I put on a disinterested look and he went away, but I was disappointed that I didn't send him off sooner. </p>
                <p>It is these religious followerse I despise. I had a friend in 5th grade who tried to convert me to Catholicism, and that ruined my good regard for him. And that bastard pastor - he has some ego thinking he can go around converting every Joe and Jane. </p>
                <p>The license plate of the Accord was VYT-2107.</p>

                <p>I got 4 hours of sleep last night and the night before. I got 4 hours on Tuesday because I was finishing an essay for AP English Language and Composition, and I got 4 hours last night because I was studying for a Spanish exam I failed. It's not good that I'm sleeping this late considering my grades. I also crashed twice in school today - in Data Structures, where I took a 10 minute nap and couldn't see clearly for 20 minutes, and BC Calculus, where I missed two pages of notes.</p>
                <p>If I'm tired this early, I'm going to be a lot more tired in January and Februrary. I'll have four Science Olympiad competitions in the first two months of 2024. Last year, I got virtually 3 hours of sleep for 3-4 days a week for 3 months straight. Just thinking about those days make me quaver inside.</p>

                <p>I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday. According to my watch, I fell asleep at 11:56 PM. I should've gotten more considering how much I missed this week. I feel asleep during Mr. Sorenson's Physics lecture and I think I might fall asleep soon. </p>
                <p>I have changed so much in the past year. I am completely different from who I was before the year to the point that I cannot recognize my former self. I met new people, my academics improved and worsened, I matured and remained a child. I had many successes; I won medals, positions, and awards. I had many defeats; I didn't win awards, my paper got rejected, and I failed to succeed academically. I left a friend. I crashed my bike. I fell in love with a campus. I'm in the middle of losing my dream. And a year ago, I couldn't have seen any of these things happening to me, nor can I guess at what's ahead.</p>
                <p>Who knows what I'll be like next year?</p>

                <p>I have so much going on this week. I have scioly every day except for Friday, I have to winterize Canterbury's garden for enviro club on Tuesday, I have to do a lab for my CONRAD group, and I had a piano lesson until I canceled it. I have a calculus test on Wednesday that I want to ace. I also have a chem test both days of the week; the FRQ is tomorrow and the MCQ is on Friday. I'm actually glad that Mr. Raimondo split up the test because I don't need to study as much for the FRQ.</p>
                <p>Lavanya just asked what I was doing on my computer. I wonder how obvious it was that I wasn't coding something but typing out words. </p>

                <p>I don't know what's wrong with me. Every part of my body hurts, and has hurt since I can remember. My eyes, my back, my knees, my chest, my head. I assume everyone else experiences that pain too. At this point I don't know if they actually do. I also don't sleep early anymore - gone are the days where I slept at 9:30. I show up to school with 3 hours of sleep and nap through my classes. I also don't eat anymore and eat 1 meal, 2 meals a day at most. My skin is tautly stretched across my ribs and my stomach is a crevasse. I can't think straight and lose my train of thought in conversation. I used to eat six pounds of food a day, but not anymore. I'm sick now too, and I think that might be because of Morgan.</p>
                <p>Actually, I'm not completely sure it's Morgan who got me sick, though. Mrs. Babcock is a possibility, but she was doing great this week and showed no symptoms. I also interacted with Luke who said he was feeling sick, but that was after he showed up to school with a mask. I also got covid before already so it's decently likely that I didn't get something from Morgan.</p>
                <p>I don't recall writing about this in my other journal, but my memories of getting covid for the first time remain vivid in my mind. Near the end of our trip in Alaska, my mother and sister and I drove away to get some food at a nearby grocery but left my father without a jacket. When we got back, the temperature had dropped to 50 degrees, and that night, he got pretty sick. He stayed up in his bunker bed and coughed all night long.</p>
                <p>The next morning, my father tested himself for covid with some kits we had packed and the result was positive. The rest of my family did the same, and it turned out we all had covid too. My father didn't want to follow covid protocols, so we decided to take the airplane the next day anyways. We all donned two N-95 masks and returned to Anchorage for our flight.</p>
                <p>I remember feeling sicker and sicker as plane flew east. There's one thing I couldn't hate any more about being sick, and that's the feeling of a sore throat. I just feel so miserable when my throat is sore and it's hard to swallow. Anyways, we rushed home after landing at the airport. I think it might have been midday when we arrived. Either way, all of us were pretty sick. One of the first things I did was take some newspapers up to my room and read them in bed because I was so tired. I propped myself up against my bed's backboards and began to read. I probably have the nicest room in the house because I have four windows including the one in my closet, which is basically small storage room. The midday sun shone through the three windows facing the front of my house, making the newspapers hard to read. The heat and light of the sun felt unfriendly. But I kept reading until I dozed off into sleep, still in my half-upright, half-laying down position.</p>
                <p>When I woke up, I had a fever and felt very hot. My entire body felt sick. The one thing I wanted was to rid myself of the heat and eliminate the pain in my back, which was agonizing. Even through my clouded thoughts I regretted having slept in a terrible position. My mind half functional, I tore downstairs and crashed onto the couch. The air conditioning and cool surface of the leather were soothing. I closed my eyes and began to sleep again.</p>
                <p>I woke up again, and this time the sickness had progressed further. I was bathed in heat and my sweat. Unable to stand the fire burning inside and on my skin, I ran downstairs again, to the basement where the air conditioning was the most effective. I dropped myself into a chair and entered slumber once more.</p>
                <p>Although I rarely dream, the visions I had while dozing then were particularly memorable. I dreamed that I was living in Alaska and was descended from a legendary family of bear hunters; my father, grandfather, and his father all hunted grizzlies and black bears across the state. We prided ourselves in this; it was more than a hobby, it was our lives. We owned axes and wore red lumberjack-style flannel shirts. Normally, my few dreams are lucid, but this one was completely beyond my controll. All details were contrived by my subconscious, and I could not play an active role in my fate in teh dream.</p>
                <p>I was sitting in my room when an enormous, dark brown grizzly bear. It burst through the drywall, sending pieces of gypsum flying across the room. In that moment, fear shot through me and I scrambled down the stairs, leaving my family, honor, and heritage behind.</p>
                <p>I woke up in the basement but the dream continued. My vision was clouded and my head was throbbing. I couldn't think and was still fully immersed in my fantasy. Still on the run, I dashed up the stairs and into the kitchen. I saw my mother and told her that there was a grizzly bear and reminded her we were bear hunters. I was fully delirious. But she didn't stop me, or couldn't, because I scrambled out of the front door. Right then a figure caught my eye - my sister, who was picking tomatoes in the garden in our front yard. I walked up to her, still hysterical. I approached her, but stopped at a tomato vine. My hand went near a tomato. I picked it off the stem. I brought it to my mouth. I took a bite.</p>
                <p>The sweet, warm juices of the golden tomato flowed onto my toungue. As if by a swtich, I woke from my dream and could finaly see clearly. I saw my sister, who looked obviously sick, and saw the green pail of tomatoes in her hand filled to about a quarter to the top. I saw the dangling branches of the tomato, weighed by its countless fruits. I saw the green grass of my lawn, the neighbor's car, the sidewalk, and a driveway. All of this before me was real - there was no bear, and I was in Virginia, not Alaska. This was my world. I knew this was real. I was overwhelmed by the <i>realness</i> - nothing about this was fake or conceived by my unknowable inner thoughts. I think I cried a little. The tomato, which I had hated eating before, tasted so delicious - because I knew it was real. I was so grateful to be here, real and in the material world.</p>
                <p>A part inside of me died a little on Thursday.</p>

                <p>Hey,</p>
                <p>I hope you aren't staying up late as you're reading this. </p>
                <p>I wanted to apologize today for my unwarranted and wholly unprofessional conduct today. I neglected my responsibilities and obligations to you as a friend, mentor, and officer. </p>
                <p>Coming to school half an hour later than what I had agreed to was the most inconsiderate thing I could have done to a person like you. Your unmatched commitment in Science Olympiad makes you one of the most valuable members - someone to be cherished and fostered. </p>
                <p>I don't know how much you sacrifice for Science Olympiad, but I do know that you've sacrificed your time, sleep, and academic progress by dedicating yourself to the program. Your work ethic has truly contributed to our team, yet I completely overlooked this in a move that was unjustifiable.</p>
                <p>There is no excuse for what I did, and I do not expect you to accept one. I only ask that you receive this expression of penitence. You are a wonderful partner, and I wish to work and lead with you for the remainder of my time at Woodson. </p>
                <p>If there is anything I can do to make up for what I did yesterday, please reach out. I hope that going forwad, we can be effective partners and work for our mutual progress.</p>
