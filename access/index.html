                <div class="intro entry-title">Entry: The Productivity of Dreams</div>
                <p>Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:27 EST</p>
                <p>I've never liked sleeping a lot. I'm often stuck in a cycle where I lose sleep, regret losing it, indulge in it, and regret indulging in it, which leads me to lose more sleep all over again. </p>
                <p>Recently, I started tracking my sleep patterns on my watch, and I have to admit it's been motivating me to improve the quality of my sleep. I try to sleep before 11 PM and get 8 hours of rest; I've also begun to wake up at 6:30 every day. Of course, 6:30 isn't ideal but it's a lot better than before, when I was filthily lazy in the mornings. The first thing I do when I get up is check my watch, because for some reason it fascinates me to see how many hours of sleep I got. I guess my watch has made sleeping into a productive activity, which has improved my regard for it. </p>
                <p>One weird thing about my sleeping habits is that I don't sleep with a pillow. At one point in the past year or two, I wondered why literally everyone slept with a pillow. I knew that the Ancient Egyptians used wooden headrests while sleeping, but as I couldn't figure out why people today had to follow them and put something under their heads while in bed. After that thought, I never considered pillows to be comfortable again.</p>
                <p>This improved the quality of my sleep profoundly. But I still haven't been able to dream regularly. The last significant dream I had was before the AP World History test on the night of May 10th, 2023. I dreamed that the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) and Short Answer Question (SAQ) sections were merged and I spent too much time on the MCQs, leaving me no time for the SAQs. In reality, I did well on the MCQ and SAQ but did terribly on the Free Response Questions (FRQs). How unprodutive of a dream.</p>
                <p>My neck is hurting now and I want to return to my bed. But I have an AP Chemistry quiz tomorrow and some AP US History work to do, so I'll linger for a bit before I go up. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Costco</div>
                <p>Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:25 PM EST</p>
                <p>One time, when I was perhaps 6 years old, my family went to a Costco warehouse when we were on a road trip. We visited Costco often, and still do today. But since this branch wasn't a one I had visited before, I didn't know the layout and got lost. I walked bewteen the towering pallets, bewildered by the goods that were stacked high above me. Only moments ago had I been within a safe radius of my parents; now I was alone and meandering. </p>
                <p>I was frightened and didn't know what to do. All of a sudden, all that had meant much to me was nowhere in sight, and the once-familiar stacks of canned and packaged food were formidable and unwelcoming. The absence of three people for just a moment had augmented my thoughts. </p>
                <p>Eventually, a staffer found me loitering in an empy lane, and taking a quick look around, found my parents just around the corner. But now, years later, that feeling of getting lost hasn't gone away. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Potbelly Cravings</div>
                <p>Wednesday 9.27.2023 11:02 pm EST</p>
                <p>The States team is having a meeting to create the teams for this year, and we'll all be eating Potbelly. My favorite restaurant chain is Potebelly by a long shot. I've always been disappointed by the low quality of Subway sandwiches because they have so little meat and every sandwich tastes the same. But each Potbelly sandwich type has a different character, and whatever you order, you always get enough filling, so you're never left unsatisfied. I can't recall the exact scenario where I first ordered a Potbelly sandwich, but I do recall being immensely pleased with how good it tasted and how filling it was.</p>
                <p>It's crazy how I've been thinking about a sandwich this entire week. I settled on an original Steakhouse Beef with mayo, extra lettuce, extra onions, extra tomatoes, cucumbers, artichoke hearts, and probably a few more things. I knew I'd feel hungry while placing my order, but ordering 7 other sandwiches was too cruel to my empty stomach. </p>
                <p>I wonder why some people view my management of our Science Olympiad team as questionable. Actually, they don't question my choices, they just complain about how I make those choices. It's not even complaining, either - they just talk amongst themselves and I find out through Jamie. I don't think I try to be overbearing, and I definitely don't make all the decisions by myself, since I'm constantly discussing things with Sophia, Zahra, and Mrs. Babcock. Honestly, I'd blame it on the incompetent Sophomores who are annoyed about Jamie, who they view as having more opportunities. Honestly, it infuriates me how they're the same people supporting Ivy and telling her tryouts test contents and structures along with her performance rankings, which I explicitly stated that they should remain private. </p>
                <p>But then again, I've been questioning decisions I've made recently, and with good reason. It's not that I'm remorseful, it's just that I may be toeing the line for what I should and should not be doing a leader of the team. So I guess those naysayers are in the same boat as I am. </p>
                <p>Man, I am so hungry right now. I would eat my calculus textbook if I didn't have to study for a quiz tomorrow.</p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Freedom and Religion</div>
                <p>Monday 10.2.2023 10:13 PM EST</p>
                <p>At this moment, I am experiencing a period of freedom that occurs once a year. My parents are out of town right now because my mom's company, New York Life, holds councils across the world where they invite their best salespeople and have them celebrate together. Up to my Freshman year, my sister and I went to every council meeting. They were somewhat excessive, but at least the company provided us with all the food, lodging, and venues. When my mom performed well certain years and qualified to attend higher councils, the entertainment and activities would be better. During the Chariman's Council in October of 2021, our family stayed at a huge resort in Phoenix and ate very well. We got shipped around in tour buses to various locations, including museums and a horseback riding venue. The trips were fun, but now my sister and I are too busy to go along. Which is why the two of us are stuck here. </p>
                <p>It's a pity that I can't drive right now. This morning, I woke up at 7:20 AM after falling asleep twice, at 6:00 and 6:30. I had 15 minutes to pack my lunch, prepare my bag, and run to the bus stop. Waking up that late was my fault, and I paid the price today by being extremely tired. I was luckly to have prepared my lunch the night before. But despite our apparent lack of self-regulation, it's nice not having my mother and father around. I have to manage a lot of things by myself; I mowed and trimmed the lawn, cooked, and did the laundry. But I feel more productive and self-directed without them here. </p>
                <p>Totally irrelevant, but I've been thinkging about religion at times recently. Not too deeply, but from time to time. I'm a strong atheist, and I believe that there could be no higher power that controls us. Religion, resultant of humanity's desire for developing social heirarchies and shielding ignorance with the supernatural, is no more factual than the Dickens book on my desk right now. My feelings for religion border on condescension. But religion has its impacts on everyone. </p>
                <p>About a month ago, I was talking with Harun about his religious beliefs. Being a Muslim, he said that he distances himself from his background's religious standards that can be viewed as racist or sexist. In other words, he had the mind to be critical of the faith he was reared in. I was inspired, and commmended him for his progressive thinking. </p>
                <p>Not long after, I was meeting with Jamie's friends in a meeting room in the City of Fairfax Public Library. One of them, Brian, was a Muslim. While we were talking, he said that he would do his prayer, and Jamie hushed me so he could conduct his prayer in silence. That moment put religion in a new light for me. From my first impressions of Brian, he seemed a kind and honest kid. And even though I looked down on religion, seeing his genuine faith in his God inspired me. Even though just a child, Brian could dedicate his virtues and character to a God and a faith, and that he would go about his religious activities in the presence and potential criticism of his peers, was just shy of a revelation. I was very impressed. </p>
                <p>I think neither pious devotion nor endorsement of progress can be measures of one's moral and religious character - they can only be measured only in terms of respect. I found Harun virtuous because he respected his own forward-thinking beliefs that stepped away from his religious traditions, and he never discussed those thoughts with the intention to actively spread them. I found Brian virtuous because he respected his beliefs but never tried to impose them on others. As long as you're true to yourself and mindful of others, I guess religion can be just as good as the absence of it. </p>
                <p>But in many cases, religion is tainted and unpure. While I was working on the lawn this Sunday, a Honda Accord drove up to our cul-de-sac and a late middle-aged Korean man stepped out. In Korean, he asked me if I was from Korea and gave me a pamphlet about their church. I didn't take a second look and put it aside, continuing to clear the driveway with my blower. The first man stepped back into the car and the driver started it, but after creeping forward for two yards, they stopped. I could tell they were watching me mow the lawn, and after around 10 minutes, the driver came out and began to talk to me. I lowered the setting on my blower before turning it off. </p>
                <p>The man introduced himself as the pastor of some church in Annandale (behing the 9292 restaurant) and began his schpiel about God. I listened out of politeness, but I knew from the start what he was trying to do. He asked what grade I was in, what my name was, and whether I went to church. I answered his questions like an idiot, but I gave him my legally unrecognized Korean name and he understood my grade incorrectly. Either way, I won't respond at all when some guy like him comes up. But back to his schpiel. He started off with a religious appeal, but seeing my lack of appreciation for his Presbyterian God, he switched to a personal appeal, saying God helps everyone. That didn't work either, so he talked about academics and college, saying God would follow me throughout my academic journey. Bullshit. I put on a disinterested look and he went away, but I was disappointed that I didn't send him off sooner. </p>
                <p>It is these religious followerse I despise. I had a friend in 5th grade who tried to convert me to Catholicism, and that ruined my good regard for him. And that bastard pastor - he has some ego thinking he can go around converting every Joe and Jane. </p>
                <p>The license plate of the Accord was VYT-2107.</p>

                <p>I got 4 hours of sleep last night and the night before. I got 4 hours on Tuesday because I was finishing an essay for AP English Language and Composition, and I got 4 hours last night because I was studying for a Spanish exam I failed. It's not good that I'm sleeping this late considering my grades. I also crashed twice in school today - in Data Structures, where I took a 10 minute nap and couldn't see clearly for 20 minutes, and BC Calculus, where I missed two pages of notes.</p>
                <p>If I'm tired this early, I'm going to be a lot more tired in January and Februrary. I'll have four Science Olympiad competitions in the first two months of 2024. Last year, I got virtually 3 hours of sleep for 3-4 days a week for 3 months straight. Just thinking about those days make me quaver inside.</p>

                <p>I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday. According to my watch, I fell asleep at 11:56 PM. I should've gotten more considering how much I missed this week. I feel asleep during Mr. Sorenson's Physics lecture and I think I might fall asleep soon. </p>
                <p>I have changed so much in the past year. I am completely different from who I was before the year to the point that I cannot recognize my former self. I met new people, my academics improved and worsened, I matured and remained a child. I had many successes; I won medals, positions, and awards. I had many defeats; I didn't win awards, my paper got rejected, and I failed to succeed academically. I left a friend. I crashed my bike. I fell in love with a campus. I'm in the middle of losing my dream. And a year ago, I couldn't have seen any of these things happening to me, nor can I guess at what's ahead.</p>
                <p>Who knows what I'll be like next year?</p>

                <p>I have so much going on this week. I have scioly every day except for Friday, I have to winterize Canterbury's garden for enviro club on Tuesday, I have to do a lab for my CONRAD group, and I had a piano lesson until I canceled it. I have a calculus test on Wednesday that I want to ace. I also have a chem test both days of the week; the FRQ is tomorrow and the MCQ is on Friday. I'm actually glad that Mr. Raimondo split up the test because I don't need to study as much for the FRQ.</p>
                <p>Lavanya just asked what I was doing on my computer. I wonder how obvious it was that I wasn't coding something but typing out words. </p>

                <p>I don't know what's wrong with me. Every part of my body hurts, and has hurt since I can remember. My eyes, my back, my knees, my chest, my head. I assume everyone else experiences that pain too. At this point I don't know if they actually do. I also don't sleep early anymore - gone are the days where I slept at 9:30. I show up to school with 3 hours of sleep and nap through my classes. I also don't eat anymore and eat 1 meal, 2 meals a day at most. My skin is tautly stretched across my ribs and my stomach is a crevasse. I can't think straight and lose my train of thought in conversation. I used to eat six pounds of food a day, but not anymore. I'm sick now too, and I think that might be because of Morgan.</p>

                <p>George Winston's music is so sad. The way he articulates each note of his flowing melodies fills me with sorrow.</p>
                <p>I got my December SAT score back the day before yesterday. I'm not sure how to feel about it. On one hand, I'm happy and relieved because I had low expectations for my score. I didn't do that well for my first SAT in August and I hadn't prepared that much. I had also been really sleepy during the reading portion, so I felt like I had messed up on a few questions. On the other hand, the score isn't as high as I wanted even back in August. I got one more question wrong on the reading and one less question wrong on the writing, so I didn't actually improve; instead, the curve was a bit more favorable for me. I guess I'll never be satisfied until I get a 1600.</p>
                <p>At least my score is right on the 50th percentile for SAT Reading and Writing scores for MIT applicants. My math score was an 800 of course, but I still feel like my overall score could be better. I won't be taking the test again anytime soon, though. If I have time next summer, I'll take the August 2024 one and try to get a perfect score; if not, I'll apply with the score I got on Friday.</p>
                <p>I don't understand why people my age are attracted to one another. They claim to love each other and it means everything to them. Can't they see that everything is futile and petty? Years, months, or even weeks later, they'll look back and recall how childish they were and how they could have made better choices, how they could have spent their childhood doing better things. Nothign they feel now is permanent. In a matter of solar orbits, they'll have graduated college and found a job and be working Or maybe I'm just pretentious. Maybe I'm claiming to be the adult I'm supposed to be on the outside, yet it's just my inner child speaking. </p>

                <p>My head is so empty right now. I feel sick too. Not a painful sickness but a queasy sickness. It's more boring than miserable. </p>
                <p>I don't know what to do. Technically, I have a lot of things to do, but they don't feel urgent, partly because I have a good amount of time before the break ends and also because a lot of it is unnecessary.</p>
                <p>I entered this high school STEM challenge called Samsung Solve for Tomorrow in October, and we got rejected this month. It was really disappoitinging because last year, when I worked with Matthew and Hailey, we won in the state and received a $14,500 prize. (Actually, it was $2,500 in a Samsung laptop and phone, $6,000 in Samsung credit, and $6,000 in credit for other vendors like Amazon and Best Buy.) I had gottten my 34 inch curved monitor and the Galaxy Watch 5 with the prize money. Considering the minimal effort we put in last year, my team this year, which consisted of me, Matthew, and Jamie, thought we would easily get past the first round. But we all raised our hopes too high. I had made a huge wishlist of things I wanted to buy, for several reasons; first, Mrs. Babcock and Matthew had taken the lion's share of products last year. I wanted to get a laptop for Jamie but Mrs. Babcock instead bought the $2,300 Galaxy Book Ultra and a super expensive easel/display while Matthew got a laptop and a phone; both of them got a smartwatch and earbuds from Samsung. This year, I wanted to get a lot of things for myself with the prize money. I had also banged up my smartwatch in the car crash and I kind of wanted a better monitor, even though the one I'm using now works great. Anyways, my wishlist ended up being more than $12,000. I put down like $1k in accessories which included a keyboard, Holy Pandas, the Logitech MX Master 3S, and the Sony WH-1000XM5s. Next, I listed the parts for a $2,000 mini-ITX PC with an i7-12700K and an RTX 4070 Founder's Edition card. I also added $3,500 of Samsung products including portable batteries, SmartTags, storage devices, a Galaxy Book Ultra, and the Galaxy Tab S9. I actually wanted the tablet because I find that they're useful for taking notes in school. Another $2,600 consisted of two Jet Bot robot vacuums and an Bespoke Jet Vacuum Cleaner AI. Lastly, I marked off $3,375 for a DJI Mini 4 Pro and the item of my desires: the Fujifilm X-100V. Man, I really wanted that camera. I hate smartphone camera photos so I wanted something of higher quality, and I loved the chrome aesthetic. Using my 2000 Olympus camera is fun at times, but it's annoyingly old becuase my dad got it 25 years ago in 1999. I also added mechanical pencils and lead to top it off. Matthew also had a similarly expensive, but not as detailed, shopping list. We both agreed that we put more time into this than the actual essays. Not that it would have made much of a difference; I bet Samsung hardly picks teams that won multiple times to maximize maketing potential.</p>
                <p>I'm also kind of disappointed because I had made a list of Apple products for Jamie to get. My plan had been to order Apple gift cards wtih Amazon gift cards we got with the prize money to get Jamie an iPhone, Apple Watch, Macbook, and better headphones. (I secretly got her AirPods by asking Kennen to buy them for me, but they're not exactly the best earbuds.) I also kind of wanted an iPhone for the blue bubbles. Anyways, that won't be happening now, which is sad becuase Jamie has been stuck with her really bad Dell laptop for years. </p>
                <p>I didn't know my dad could see what was on my monitor screen. I assumed the curvature was enough for him to be unable to view the content on it, but I guess he saw enough to see that I was on the Costco site looking for tablets. I really wanted to get the Tab S9, but that won't be happening anytime soon, or at all. </p>
                <p>I'm adding this quite a while later (I edit some previous entries) but me, Matthew, or Mrs. Babcock never felt bad about leaving Hailey in the dust...</p>

                <p>I'm studying in the library right now. I wasn't getting anything done at home so I decided to change things up a bit. I think I'm more focused now, but where I'm sitting, it's too bright to use my computer screen easily. The wall in front of me is entirely made of glass blocks. Too bad the Kings Park Public Library doesn't have a lot of good study spaces lik the City of Fairfax Regional one does. </p>
                <p>I want to travel somwhere. I feel restless, working all day at home on schoolwork or Science Olympiad. I have proress in the material world, but I don't feel like I'm developing as a person. I want to go back to Alaska, to taste the fresh air and wade barefoot in the icy, blue-green streams. I want to see the snow-covered mountains and the evergreen forests, the broad rivers and the endless valleys. I want to go back to that bitter yet beautiful landscape, and let it kindle a fire inside of me with its magical immenseness. Thinking about that place makes me feel like I'm missing something.</p>

                <p>Things in my house are so messed up right now. My parents won't talk to each other at all and use me and my sister as intermediaries. Some things are easier now that my father doesn't talk to us in the presence of my mother, but it makes the household overall more tense. Yesterday my mother asked if I could ask my father when he would buy a new washing machine, since it's broken right now. I never imagined things would get this bad. In the next two years, I think they'll get a lot closer to divorcing. </p>

                <p>In the past two days (yesterday and today), I've written a thousand lines of code, coded at my desk for more than 16 hours, and run 4 miles. I could have been more productive but it's an improvement. I got absolutely nothing done in the past week. Actually, that hasn't changed for my academics - I have to pick up my Calculus and APUSH work again. And scioly - I have a lot of catching up to do for Detector, Fermi, and Robot.</p>
                <p>Note to self: change the root domain page (this page) to an about me and make this journal less accessible. I think I'll keep the digital rain aesthetic for the main page, though. It's grown on me quite a bit. Another note to self: use your headphones less. My ears are starting to hurt after playing music and using noise cancelling so much recently.</p>

                <p>I panicked and removed my entry from index.html. I have a file added to my gitignore, and I copied all of the contents of index.html into the file I'm writing into right now. I don't know for sure that someone looked at my journal, but I'm not taking any chances.</p>
                <p>I made an hourly plan for the next four days. Looking at my schedule and all the things I have to do was momentarily overwhelming. But I can't feel stress.</p>

                <p>I got around restructuring my journal files. I don't know if my changes will prevent people from finding my journal. If someone already found my journal, then they'll know what they're looking for and could probably find it quickly. But I don't know if someone looking at the repo for the first time will locate this file easily. After all, they can just search for keywords in the repo.</p>
                <p>Winter break is drawing to a close, and I'm disappointed at how little I got done during this break. I was too stressed to do work, and now I have four days to do schoolwork, CONRAD, Science Fair, and Science Olympiad. I don't expect to sleep for a few days next week.</p>
                <p>Scioly is an embarrassment right now. First of all, Sophia hasn't talked with Zahra and me about the t-shirts at all. I asked Mrs. Babcock what the situation was but she hasn't responded either. If we don't order by next Tuesday, we'll be paying $180 for rapid 3-day shipping. I saw an Instagram post by VASO with questions from previous years and I thought they were questions for States this year and sent screenshots in States chat. I'm literally Vice President. I'm actively ruining myself. Also, the battery Matthew gave me for Robot Tour is dead so I can't test the code that I've optimized (well, I found how to optimize it but haven't written it out yet). I also don't have the 1.0 molar Copper (II) Sulfate solution I need for Detector Building to make a salt bridge.</p>
                <p>Was I too stressed to do work? Or am I incompetent? Either way, I have to spend the next four days effectively. That starts by going to sleep early today.</p>
                <p>Indra was the only person who contacted me this break. I think her "merry christmas" message made my day that day. I don't know what I'm doing, but my friends... I don't even know what's going on between me and my friends. When I ran into Harun at the library he was so formal. And James has been distancing himself from me and Jamie after our falling-out. As for Matthew and Indra, they've always been wonderful friends, but I don't know what to talk about with them. Have I ever known, though?</p>

                <p>The Fairfax Invitational was supposed to be tomorrow but it got canceled due to rain and snow. It won't even rain that much, yet the county canceled all school-related activities for the entire day. I was feeling pretty miserable already from not having slept at all last night, but the cancellation made me feel even worse. Fairfax was supposed to be the trial run before our important competitions... In my view, all of the study events worked much harder than they did in previous years. Katie managed Towers excellently, and all three teams for Air Trajectory and Flight did so much work over the break. I genuinely wanted to see how everyone's increased commitment would translate into performance, but that won't be happenign now.</p>
                <p>Not all events were well-run, though. Optics and Wind Power are pretty tricky so all three teams had minimal preparation. But the worst by far was Scrambler. Enzo had to finish his college applications and only began working on his car yesterday. I was actually so mad because he could have sent me all the files to print over break, but he was stupid enough to not care about his own build on top of the Regional teams' build. </p>
                <p>That's probably enough for now. I should to bed now, considering my <a href="../assets/fairfax-sleep.png" target="_blank">sleep log</a> for today. I slept for 10 minutes in Mrs. Babccok's room, the entirety of Data Structures, and most of Calculus. It was weird but also kind of funny how Mr. Kim would come to my side and ask me in Korean if I was okay because I had my head down for his entire lecture.</p>
                <p>Anyways, time to finish what I worked on at 4am yesterday and create some copper electrodes. My soldering iron will never see the end of me.</p>

                <p>Two days ago I tried to write about how I became Vice President of Woodson Science Olympiad. I did a pretty bad job, so I archived it for now.</p>
                <p>I've been listening to so much popular music nowadays that I've lost a bit of my classical music. I still listen to Jan Lisiecki's Chopin Etudes of course, but not much other classical music. But right now, I'm listening to classical piano, and it's absolutely wonderful. Actually, my Spotify began to play a flute sonata but I switched it back to piano. Anyways, listening to Clair de Lune made me think of how three years ago, I would relish in playing and listening to classical music more than anything else. I thoroughly mastered Chopin's Fantasie-Impromptu, the third movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, and Debussy's Claire de Lune. I long to go back and play those melodies, hearing the notes, manipulated by my mind through my fingers to be delicate or powerful, intricate or explicit, sounding from the long strings of a pianoforte. But it's too late, as I've forgotten too much of the notes.</p>

                <p>It's funny how I'm writing again in the same class perid exactly one week after my previous entry. I guess I feel particularly bored and unproductive during Mr. Sorenson's physics lectures.</p>
                <p>Today is the first day of school this week. There was no school on Monday because it was MLK day, and since it snowed 2 inches Monday night, Tuesday was canceled and we had a two-hour delay today.</p>

                <p>I intended to write more during Physics but I ended up doing work for Lang instead. I didn't delete the unfinished entry though, for the sake of accuracy.</p>
                <p>The Carnegie Mellon University Science Olympiad Invitational is in two days, on Saturday, January 20th. After Fairfax was cancelled, I was really looking forward to it, but it looks like it'll get cancelled. I'm not completely sure, but there are so many things that could happen that could lead to us not competing. </p>
                <p>First, it's snowing all day Friday, so school could get canceled then. I think Mrs. Babcock doesn't see a school closure as impacting us, but Sophia and Zahra do. The same goes for principal approval; if we tell Mr. Greata about the trip, he'll 100% cancel it since he probably didn't know about it beforehand. Also, we're expecting a number of parents to bail out and not drive. Two parents already responded saying they wouldn't drive, and I'm expecting two more to do the same.</p>
                <p>I'm really sad and kind of overwhelmed... my grades aren't looking good and I have other things to worry about too. Hailey reached out to me last night which is why I stayed up 2 hours later than I had planned, and I also got sick two days ago. Like Mrs. Babcock said the Thursday before Fairfax, my "dreams of grandeur may be falling apart." Honestly, that's the worst part - losing our bid for nats. I set up our track record to be so competitive, but now it's torn to pieces. One in-person invitational before Regionals? Ridiculous. I think I'll write about that tomorrow, though. </p>
                <p>Even Indra pointed out that I looked overwhelmed. I want to write, but for tonight, I have to pack my Detector stuff and get sleep.</p>
